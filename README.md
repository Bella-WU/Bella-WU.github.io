### Description
During my first semester in MAFDT, I took elective Web Advanced: Javascript in order to consolidate and expand my skills in web development with JavaScript and jQuery. This course was taught by Todd Anderson (https://toddwords.com/) (https://github.com/toddwords).

### My Projects
#### :one: Generative Website

Use some form of generative text, either selecting text from a list, Tracery or Markov Chain. Can be any kind of web page, with any look, be creative!
